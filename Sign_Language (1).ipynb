    "This class OptimizedSLICExtractor is a custom utility for extracting superpixels from images using the SLIC (Simple Linear Iterative Clustering) algorithm, but optimized with caching for speed.<br/> Normally, SLIC segmentation is recomputed every time an image is processed, which slows down training, so this class saves (caches) the computed superpixels, features, and graph structure in a .pkl file the first time an image is processed, and reloads them directly in later runs.<br/> For each image, it converts to RGB, resizes to 224×224, applies SLIC segmentation, then extracts features for each superpixel (like centroid position, area, mean color, texture variation, and bounding box).<br/> After that, it builds a graph adjacency matrix where nodes are superpixels and edges connect nearby ones, based on centroid distance.<br/> The combination of caching, feature extraction, and graph adjacency construction ensures that images are represented efficiently in a form suitable for graph-based machine learning models (like GCN or GAT), while preserving the original GmTC method’s authenticity.\n"

    "The `OptimizedSLICExtractor` class provides a **cached pipeline** for generating SLIC superpixels, extracting per-superpixel features, and constructing a graph adjacency matrix.\n",
    "This design ensures heavy computations are done **once during data loading** and reused during training.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 🔹 Initialization\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "def __init__(self, n_segments=50, compactness=10, sigma=1, cache_dir='./slic_cache')\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "* Stores SLIC parameters (`n_segments`, `compactness`, `sigma`).\n",
    "* Creates a cache directory (`./slic_cache`) if it doesn’t exist.\n",

    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "def extract_superpixels_cached(self, image_path)\n",
    "```\n",
    "1. **Check Cache**: If a cached result exists, load it via `pickle`.\n",
    "2. **Image Load**: If not cached, load the image with OpenCV (`cv2.imread`), convert **BGR → RGB**, and resize to **224×224**.\n",
    "3. **Segmentation**: Apply **SLIC segmentation** (`skimage.segmentation.slic`) to produce superpixel labels.\n",
    "4. **Feature Extraction**: Call `extract_superpixel_features`.\n",
    "5. **Graph Construction**: Call `create_graph_adjacency`.\n",

    "\n",
    "This script defines and executes an **optimized training pipeline** for the **GmTC (Graph-based Multi-modal Texture Classification)** model. It maintains the authenticity of the original GmTC research architecture while adding **engineering optimizations** for speed, memory efficiency, and stability.\n",
    "\n",
    "###  Core Components (Authentic GmTC)\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **SLIC Superpixel Extraction**\n",
    "\n",
    "   * Uses `OptimizedSLICExtractor` to segment input images into meaningful superpixels.\n",
    "   * Features are cached into `.pkl` files for speedup during repeated runs.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Graph Convolutional Network (GCN)**\n",
    "\n",
    "   * Builds a graph over superpixels where nodes represent regions and edges capture spatial adjacency.\n",
    "   * Uses an efficient `OptimizedGCNModule` for feature propagation.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Multi-Head Self Attention (MHSA)**\n",
    "\n",
    "   * Applies `OptimizedMHSA` to model long-range dependencies between superpixels.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Grain Module (CNN Backbone)**\n",
    "\n",
    "   * ResNet backbone (`resnet34` or `resnet50`) extracts fine-grained visual features.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **Feature Refining Module (IRFFN)**\n",
    "\n",
    "   * `OptimizedIRFFN` performs residual feed-forward refinement with expansion and compression layers.\n",
    "\n",
    "6. **Feature Fusion**\n",
    "\n",
    "   * Combines CNN features, GCN outputs, and attention-enhanced representations.\n",

    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### ⚡ Optimizations Added\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Superpixel caching**: avoids recomputation → large **speed boost**.\n",
    "* **Mixed precision training**: reduces memory and improves throughput.\n",
    "* **Efficient graph operations**: speeds up adjacency computation.\n",
    "* **Batch normalization & dropout**: better convergence and generalization.\n",
    "* **Reduced max samples per class (demo)**: keeps training lightweight in testing mode.\n",

    "1. **Initialize SLIC extractor** (with caching).\n",
    "2. **Create train & validation datasets** (`GmTCDataset`) with superpixel features.\n",
    "3. **Load data with DataLoader** (shuffling, batching, collation).\n",
    "4. **Build OptimizedGmTC model** (with all authentic components).\n",
    "5. **Train using Optimized Trainer** (early stopping, LR scheduling, checkpointing).\n",
    "6. **Evaluate on validation set** (final accuracy report).\n",
    "7. **Print summary**:\n",
    "\n",
    "   * Training time vs. original (~6–10x faster).\n",
    "   * Best/Final accuracy.\n",
    "   * Memory efficiency.\n",

    "This script sets up a testing framework for the optimized GmTC (Graph-based Multi-modal Texture Classification) model, allowing evaluation of a trained model on an ISL dataset. It begins by defining the dataset path (DATASET_PATH) and model checkpoint path (MODEL_PATH), then checks if the dataset exists. If found, it scans the dataset directory to automatically detect and sort the available classes, treating each subfolder as a class label. With the class list and model checkpoint, it initializes the GmTCModelTester, which loads the trained model and prepares it for evaluation tasks. The script outputs the number of discovered classes, confirms the readiness of the testing framework, and gracefully handles missing dataset paths by prompting the user to update them. In essence, it ensures that both the dataset and trained model are correctly set up before proceeding with testing, making it the entry point for validating model performance."

      "This confusion matrix represents the classification performance of the OptimizedGmTC model across multiple classes (numbers and letters). Ideally, perfect classification appears as a strong diagonal line (where predicted labels match the true labels), and here we see most values concentrated along that diagonal, indicating high accuracy. For example, classes like 5, G, H, J, L, N, P, R, T, X, Y, Z are predicted perfectly with no misclassifications. However, some off-diagonal entries show where the model made mistakes—for instance, a few samples of C were misclassified as B, N was misclassified as O, and V was confused with U. These errors suggest that certain classes have visual or structural similarities that the model struggles to distinguish. Overall, the confusion matrix indicates that the model performs strongly, with only minor confusions in visually similar categories, reflecting robust learning while highlighting areas for further refinement.\n"

    "f_doc_string='''This graph shows the confidence analysis of your model’s predictions. On the left, the histogram plots the distribution of confidence scores for correct predictions (green) and incorrect predictions (red). We can see that correct predictions are mostly clustered at high confidence values (around 0.9–1.0), while incorrect predictions are spread out across lower confidence ranges (0.4–0.7). On the right, the box plot summarizes this difference: correct predictions have a higher median confidence (≈0.89) with a tighter spread, whereas incorrect predictions have a lower median confidence (≈0.55) and a wider spread. The takeaway is that the model is generally well-calibrated — when it is confident, it is usually correct, and when it makes mistakes, its confidence tends to be lower. This kind of analysis helps assess not just accuracy but also how trustworthy the model’s confidence scores are.'''\n",

We can see that correct predictions are mostly clustered at high confidence values (around 0.9–1.0), while incorrect predictions are spread out across lower confidence ranges (0.4–0.7). On the right, the box plot summarizes this difference: correct predictions have a higher median confidence (≈0.89) with a tighter spread, whereas incorrect predictions have a lower median confidence (≈0.55) and a wider spread. The takeaway is that the model is generally well-calibrated — when it is confident, it is usually correct, and when it makes mistakes, its confidence tends to be lower. This kind of analysis helps assess not just accuracy but also how trustworthy the model’s confidence scores are."
